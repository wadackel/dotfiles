# Iterate on PR Until CI Passes

Continuously iterate on the current branch until all CI checks pass and review feedback is addressed.

**Requires**: GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated and available.

## Process

### Step 1: Identify the PR

```bash
gh pr view --json number,url,headRefName,baseRefName
```

If no PR exists for the current branch, stop and inform the user.

### Step 2: Check CI Status First

Always check CI/GitHub Actions status before looking at review feedback:

```bash
gh pr checks --json name,state,bucket,link,workflow
```

The `bucket` field categorizes state into: `pass`, `fail`, `pending`, `skipping`, or `cancel`.

### Step 3: Gather Review Feedback

Once CI checks have completed (or at least the bot-related checks), gather human and bot feedback:

**Review Comments and Status:**
```bash
gh pr view --json reviews,comments,reviewDecision
```

**Inline Code Review Comments:**
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments
```

**PR Conversation Comments (includes bot comments):**
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr_number}/comments
```

### Step 4: Investigate Failures

For each CI failure, get the actual logs:

```bash
# List recent runs for this branch
gh run list --branch $(git branch --show-current) --limit 5 --json databaseId,name,status,conclusion

# View failed logs for a specific run
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

Do NOT assume what failed based on the check name alone. Always read the actual logs.

### Step 5: Validate Feedback

For each piece of feedback (CI failure or review comment):

1. **Read the relevant code** - Understand the context before making changes
2. **Verify the issue is real** - Not all feedback is correct; reviewers and bots can be wrong
3. **Check if already addressed** - The issue may have been fixed in a subsequent commit
4. **Skip invalid feedback** - If the concern is not legitimate, move on

### Step 6: Address Valid Issues

Make minimal, targeted code changes. Only fix what is actually broken.

### Step 7: Commit and Push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: <descriptive message of what was fixed>"
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### Step 8: Wait for CI

Use the built-in watch functionality:

```bash
gh pr checks --watch --interval 30
```

This waits until all checks complete. Exit code 0 means all passed, exit code 1 means failures.

Alternatively, poll manually if you need more control:

```bash
gh pr checks --json name,state,bucket | jq '.[] | select(.bucket != "pass")'
```

### Step 9: Repeat

Return to Step 2 if:
- Any CI checks failed
- New review feedback appeared

Continue until all checks pass and no unaddressed feedback remains.

## Exit Conditions

**Success:**
- All CI checks are green (`bucket: pass`)
- No unaddressed human review feedback

**Ask for Help:**
- Same failure persists after 3 attempts (likely a flaky test or deeper issue)
- Review feedback requires clarification or decision from the user
- CI failure is unrelated to branch changes (infrastructure issue)

**Stop Immediately:**
- No PR exists for the current branch
- Branch is out of sync and needs rebase (inform user)

## Tips

- Use `gh pr checks --required` to focus only on required checks
- Use `gh run view <run-id> --verbose` to see all job steps, not just failures
- If a check is from an external service, the `link` field in checks JSON provides the URL to investigate
